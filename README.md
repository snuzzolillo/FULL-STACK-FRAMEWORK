# WEB APPLICATION FULLSTACK FRAMEWORK
FULL STACK FRAMEWORK Based on RDBMS Potencial 

Conceptualization Phase.

**Introduction** Friday, January 17, 2020 3:43 PM

## Objective:
Create a framework that covers all areas (FULLSTACK) for the development of Web Applications.

The technological base is framed in the Client (Web Browser) and the server (Web Server) with a communication link (Internet, Intranet, VPN).

The Web Server (or simply Server) must be based on a robust structure and supported by a database engine as a base pillar.

## Conceptualization:
**Web Application:**

> Application?](onenote:#Web%20Application%20(fullstack)&section-id={408A535E-6A6B-4D18-8D08-23694B0A4284}&page-id={4054A42C-7D0B-4982-9D7F-F15CD3E191ED}&object-id={A97784D8-A313-465A-8FE6-398512325A65}&1B&base-path=SEVEN12\Users\PROGRESO_PC\Documents\OneNote%20Notebooks\DESARROLLO\JS-FORMS%20full%20stack.one)

 

> **What is not a Web Application: A Website**
>
> \"A website is a group of globally accessible, interlinked web pages
> which have a single domain name. It can be developed and maintained by
> an individual, business or organization. The website aims to serve a
> variety of purposes. Example: Blogs.
>
>  
>
> A website is hosted on a single or multiple web server. It is
> accessible via a network like the Internet or a private local area
> network via IP address\".

> **What is a Web Application:**
>
> \"A web application is a software or program which is accessible using
> any web browser. Its frontend is usually created using languages like
> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, which are supported by major browsers. While
> the backend could use any programming stack like LAMP, MEAN, etc.
> Unlike mobile apps, there is no specific SDK for developing web
> applications.
>
>  
>
> Web Applications came to prominence with the advent of Software as a
> Service (SaaS) movement\".

>  
>
> **Difference between Web Site and Web Application.**
>
> A web application executes a \"business logic\", that is, it applies a
> series of routines that capture and transfer data and transform the
> data into other data or information.
>
>  
>
> \"Data transformation\", \"Business logic\" and \"Business rules\" are
> synonyms.
>
>  
>
> The capture and transformation of the data follow a sequential and
> linear logic. The timeline in which the transformation occurs is
> extremely important and the data captured or transformed is
> \"formal\", for example, the conditions of a contract or a financial
> transaction must be rigorous and an uncontrolled error would be of
> important consequences. \"Formal\" means that it must be validated and
> pass through the Integrity controls of the Database in addition to
> ensuring \"the quality of the data\", that is, emphasize the
> consistency of the data, a task that must be delegated to the database
> manager. A transaction can consist of several steps (or processes) and
> each of them is subject to validation errors or data consistency. If
> the above occurs, it must be notified in a timely manner (usually
> through an error message) and stop the operation until this condition
> is overcome.
>
>  
>
> Although the interfaces may be the same or similar, the interface of
> an application must, in addition to helping or facilitating the user,
> be formal and must minimize the error.
>
>  
>
> The websites (or web pages) sometimes have the luxury of hiding
> errors, since their main interest is the presentation of the
> information and it must be attractive, so the unwanted display of an
> error line causes the page to lose sight, That\'s why some programmers
> tend to turn off error levels.
>
>  
>
> A web application must handle, manipulate and report on the occurrence
> of errors, must be strict in the entries and validation of data and
> must put validation and effectiveness before the presentation or show.
>
>  
>
> **Web Page (Website or website). Main features.**
>
> • It is essentially informative.
>
> • Little or no data capture.
>
> • Data capture can be formal or informal. That is, the omission of one
> of the data or the veracity of it may not be relevant.
>
> • Little or no data transformation (or application of \"Business
> Rules\")
>
> • A lot of visual activity.
>
> • Priority of the eye-catching visual interface.
>
> • A lot of audio-visual (or multimedia) help.
>
> • You can have a Web Application immersed (or embedded or embedded).
>
> • Asynchronous access techniques for quick viewing. The timeline in
> which events occur is usually NOT important.
>
>  
>
> **Web Application. Main features.**\
> • It is essentially Operational.\
> • Emphasizes the capture of formal data and much validation. An
> application makes no sense if it does not interact with the user.\
> • Data capture is formal. In other words, the omission of one of them
> has explicit meaning and the veracity of the data must be checked,
> again, with as much validation as possible.\
> • A lot of data transformation (or application of \"Business Rules\")\
> • It does not emphasize visual activity other than that of
> facilitating data entry.\
> • It has no priority in the sight of the visual interface, although it
> is always desirable.\
> • Little or no audio-visual (or multimedia) help is not relevant. It
> can be helpful for documentation or user manual.\
> • You can have another application immersed but never a web page (or
> website).\
> • Asynchronous access may not be a facility. The formality of the data
> requires that the transformation occur in a given time line. This is a
> high point in the discussion forums where those who support the
> exclusively asynchronous process, and therefore the \"deprecation\"
> (deprecated) of the synchronous, always show examples of how to solve
> the sequence of the timeline and the assurance of transaction
> completed through \"callbacks\", which would work, but are based on
> very simple examples and almost always under a single condition. From
> my point of view, in an application the timeline and conditioning can
> be complex and varied, which would generate a chain of \"callbacks\"
> that, among other problems (which must be lived to understand them),
> would be extremely complicated the subsequent maintenance.,\
> • They must be flexible and easy to maintain, assuming the possibility
> of constant changes in human resources within the project
> (coordinators, programmers and even end users) as well as changes in
> the \"Business Rules\".
>
>  
>
> The dividing line between if we are talking about a web page or a web
> application can be very thin, but the basic concept to differentiate
> it is the depth with which it handles the capture and transformation
> of the data.
>
>  
>
> This differentiation is made because it is common to see programmers
> who are developing a web application but use a lot of the time solving
> visual elements that are more for the use of a web page than an
> application.
>
>  
>
> When selecting a standard or development method for web applications,
> it is important to highlight these visual elements and take them in a
> practical (and standard) way that minimizes programming time.
>
>  
>
> When both elements are required to be included, that is, the
> attractiveness of a web page and the practicality of a web
> application, then the web applications are embedded in the web pages
> giving the feeling that the entire site or interface is one.
>
>  
>
> It must be easy to maintain, that is,
>
>  
>
> Flexible: Being able to absorb new business rules minimizing
> reprogramming or restructuring of data.
>
>  
>
> Change or Incorporation of human resources: Refers to the ability to
> add or replace programmers to a development project without implying
> changes in the structure or data models, which usually happens when
> the new programmer fails to understand the logic or sequence of data
> transformation so he decides to use his own knowledge base and
> reimplement according to his criteria and understanding, this usually
> happens when in development projects there are few standards and many
> possible solutions. It is also known that, since there are no
> standards or these are scarce, it allows the programmer free will and
> the constant search for solutions, sometimes implementing their own
> techniques that are unknown to the rest of the group. Additionally,
> the constant search for new possible ways to solve a problem is the
> implication of wasted human resources and the loss or reconstruction
> of the previous knowledge base.

  **Layer**   **Side**           **Stack Element**                                  **Short Description**
  ----------- ------------------ -------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Layer 0     Browser Level      CCS - JS -HTML                                     Only visual handling like styles, elements locations, etc.
  Layer 1     Browser Level      JS                                                 Interface Interaction Management (or GUI interaction) normally as response to events.
  Layer 2     Browser - Server   Link. . Ajax (XMLHttpRequest ) ? SSE? WebSocket?   Manage communication between Client (Web Browser) - Server (Any web server, any protocol). It requires a standard criteria for the \"sending of requirement data\" as a request and \"receipt of the required data\" in response to the request.
  Layer 3     Server             Server Scripts                                     Any web script capable of responding to an http request (or other protocol). Handles \"Client\" requests. Responds to requests, receives data, delivers data, interacts with the database layer (layer 4).
  Layer 4     Server             DataBase                                           Any SQL engine (MySql, Oracle, Postgres, Sql Server, Sqlite, etc.) or Flat files such as CSV, excel, dbf etc.

> The FULLSTACK must have three fundamental components

-   The Builder

-   The Generator (or Compiler)

-   The Runtime.

>  
>
> It must also cover two operational aspects:

-   FORMS: Data entry, Data Query, Data Processing.

-   REPORTS **(\*)**: Data Visualization, Data Report

> **(\*) This section will be in the background within the construction
> phases of FRAMEWORK. (Stimulsoft)**

 

**The Builder: Building a Web Application**

Build a Web Application with the framework, must be with an integrated
environment (**builder**) that allows solving the entire life cycle
without embedding external elements or combining other frameworks.

 

> **The Forms builder:**

-   A unique interface (GUI) that standardizes how to solve the
    > interaction problems between the different layers.

-   Construction is based on Objects definitions and attributes.

-   Ability to program response to events in a standard way (Triggers in
    > response to events)

-   Ability to build the visual part through definitions and visual
    > attributes (usually CSS) in such a way that the visual
    > representation is standard.

-   Hide or make transparent the communication between the browser and
    > the server.

>
> **\*\*\*\*\*IMAGE: Example of an interface for the builder. Built in
> JS.**

> **(\*) This is a functional example of a prototype for the Form
> Builder\'s vision. Este protipo fue construido a partir de las
> especificaciones y caracteristicas de Oracle Form Developer V6.**
>
>  
>
>  
>
> **The Forms programming language:**

-   The programming language for the \"triggers\" on the server side is
    > SQL (as \"Database compound statement\", like pl/sql, pg/sql,
    > mariaDB sql Language, etc).

-   The native language of the server (for the prototype instance, PHP
    > will be used) will only be an intermediary for \"transfer and
    > response\" browser\'s requirements.

-   The creation of a compiler is presumed to hide the JS code of the
    > browser side triggers and pre-builds visual elements.

 

> **The Report builder:**

-   A unique interface (GUI) that standardizes how to solve the
    > interaction problems between the different layers.

-   Construction is based on definitions and attributes.

-   Based on, included or interacting with StimulSoft [**Report
    > Designer**](https://www.stimulsoft.com/en/products/reports-net)

 

**The Runtime: Executing a Web Application**

>  
>
> **MDI Concept**
>
> \"A multiple-document interface (MDI) is a graphical user interface in
> which multiple windows reside under a single parent window. Such
> systems often allow child windows to embed other windows inside them
> as well, creating complex nested hierarchies. This contrasts with
> single-document interfaces (SDI) where all windows are independent of
> each other.
>
>  
>
> MDI can be confusing if it has a lack of information about the
> currently opened windows. In MDI applications, the application
> developer must provide a way to switch between documents or view a
> list of open windows, and the user might have to use an
> application-specific menu (\"window list\" or something similar) to
> switch between open documents. This is different from SDI applications
> where the window manager\'s task bar or task manager displays the
> currently opened windows. In recent years it has become increasingly
> common for MDI applications to use \"tabs\" to display the currently
> opened windows. An interface in which tabs are used to manage open
> documents is referred to as a \"[tabbed document
> interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabbed_document_interface)\"
> (TDI). Another option is \"tiled\" panes or windows, which make it
> easier to prevent content from overlapping.\"

**MDI =** An HTML page. His BODY element take the control of all visible
area into a \"Tab Browser\". May have a layout. Is a One Page Control.
Inside this HTML, FORMS and REPORTS will be executed.

>  
>
> **FORM Concept**

FORM es la unidad minima de Ejecucion usada para Data entry, Data Query,
Data Processing. Una FORM se ejecuta dentro de una MDI(\*). Su instancia
dentro del MDI es un elemento HTML **iframe** cuya ejecucion es
independiente de otras FORMS dentro del MDI.

Manejo visual

FORM

-   CANVAS . Concepto Visual, contiene 1 mas items de visualizcion

    -   Page1 (NON STAKED)

    -   Page2 (NON STAKED)

        -   Page 3 - Stacked Page

    -   Page4 (TABBED)

        -   TAB1 -- IS A PAGE

        -   TAB2 -- IS A PAGE

-   WINDOW - Concepto visual contiene uno o mas canvas

    -   WONDOW1

    -   WINDOW2

>  

-   Una forma puede tener una o mas "window".

-   Una forma puede tener uno o mas "Page".

-   Un "Page" puede tener ninguna, una o mas de una "Stacked Page".

-   Los "Page" estan asociada a un unico "WINDOW".

-   los "Stacked Page" estan asociado a un unico "Page". NON-STAKED =
    > parent, STACKED=Child

>  

**FORM**: The minimal "execution unit". Is an IFRAME element into de
MDI. His visual representation may be as TAB elements managed by the
MDI, a FLOATING WINDOW managed by the MDI or ANY other visual
representation managed by the MDI. Multiples FORM can run at the same
time. Comunication between FORMS can occurs, but is not relevant.
Assuming that a FORM is a specific "execution unit". A FORM can be RUN
(start) or CLOSED (end).

>  

**WINDOW**: a window is the very top visual element into the FORM. A
FORM must have at least one WINDOW and can have more than one. The FORM
Definition will pick one that will be the BODY of the IFRAME, others
WINDOWS will be a DIV into the IFRAME. A non BODY WINDOW can be HIDDEN
or SHOWED programmatically.

 

> **CANVAS**: Is a DIV into a WINDOW (also know as pane). Is the minimal
> element where a container (or visual item element) can be represented,
> a WINDOW must have at least one canvas. A WINDOW can have more than 1
> CANVAS.
>
>  
>
> Pueden haber 3 tipo de PAGE.

-   **TABBED CANVAS**: (is a DIV into a WINDOW) Is a KIND of CANVAS that
    > have a TAB style management (at least 1 TB, or more than 1 TAB).
    > Every TAB has same functionality as NON-STACKED CANVAS .

 

-   **STAKED CANVAS**: (Is a DIV into the DIV of the parent PAGE (a
    > NON-STACKED CANVAS ). Is a KIND of PAGE that must be staked into a
    > NON-STAKED CANVAS .

 

-   **TOOLBAR CANVAS**: (is a DIV into a WINDOW.) Is a PAGE that take a
    > fixed position into a WINDOW, thas is TOP, LEFT, RIGTH or BOTTOM.

 

> Only one NON-STACKED CANVAS is Visible at the time.

 

> **VISIBLE ITEM**: La estructura de datos de FORMS esta conformada por
> DATA BLOCKs a DATA BLOCK can have 1 o r more Items. Any ITEM of the
> DATA BLOCK can have a visual representation or not. A VISIBLE ITEM is
> Located into a specific CANVAS.
>
>  

**CURSOR**: Is a logical concept (same concept that the "focus"). When a
FORM run at the FIRST TIME, the CURSOR is located (automatically or
programmatically) at a Visible Item. The WINDOW with the CANVAS with the
VISIBLE ITEM where the CURSOS is (have de focus), will be SHOWED.
